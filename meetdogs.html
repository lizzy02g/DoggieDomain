  <center><h1> Meet the Dogs!</h1></center>

  <p>Here you can see some of our amazing dogs who are currently looking for homes. These are a few of the dogs who have spent time in our shelter but are now available to buy and be taken care of by other families.

  <p> Jerry was found on the streets and brought to us just over 3 years ago. He was in a bad condition but has recovered very well here and is ready to move on to another family. </p>

  <p>Stanley is still a very young dog, brought to us just months ago as a puppy. His playfulness and energy makes him lots of fun.</p>

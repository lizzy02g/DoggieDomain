  <center><h1>About Us</h1></center>

  <div class="dogPic"><img src="pictures/aboutdog.jpg" alt="dog" style="width: 550px; height: 305px;"></div><center><p style="font-size:20px;"> Here at Doggie Domain our main concern is the welfare of our dogs. We do our best to ensure all dogs that come to us are properly looked after to be healthy and happy. No matter what condition a dog is in when it's brought to us, we will always to our best to help it recover and prpare it for new life with another family.</p></center>
  <br>
  <center><p style="font-size:20px;"> It is important to us that all our dogs are given the physical help and treatment they need and this is why you are important. Your donations help us give the dogs the medical treatment as well as basic care they may need. Our dogs come from all sorts of different places and are brought to us all in different conditions and we strive to give them each what they need.
    Physical care is not the only important thing, but also that the dogs are genuinely cared about by the staff at Doggie Domain. Each dog is unique and separately cared for and understood by the carers. This is why it is important to us that when each dog has recovered, they move on to a life with a new loving and caring family.</p></center>
